This repository contains code for implementing our signal subgraph classifier.

A manuscript describing the theory behind this work is available from a github repository called ind_edge_classifier, which also includes older/slower versions of the code, scripts to generate figures, etc.

Please post any issues in the issues tab.

Thank you.
